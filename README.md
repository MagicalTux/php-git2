# libgit2 bindings for PHP 7

Because I need libgit2 and the implementation at https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 is not maintained anymore (and no PHP7 implementation currently exists) I decided to put one together quickly.

This implementation __requires__ PHP7 and implements classes unlike the libgit2 version, because it makes more sense.

Work in progress. Methods I need will be implemented first.

## Requirements

PHP 7.0 or above.
